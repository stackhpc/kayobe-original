Deployment of Scientific OpenStack using OpenStack kolla.

Kayobe is an open source tool for automating deployment of Scientific OpenStack
onto a set of bare metal servers.  Kayobe is composed of Ansible playbooks, a
python module, and makes heavy use of the OpenStack kolla project.  Kayobe aims
to complement the kolla-ansible project, providing an opinionated yet highly
configurable OpenStack deployment and automation of many operational
procedures.
